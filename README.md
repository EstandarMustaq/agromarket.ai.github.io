## Executive Summary

AgroMarket AI provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing our **MVP** and **MVP Lite** solutions. This document outlines our technical architecture, API specifications, and implementation strategy for creating an accessible, resilient marketplace optimized for Mozambique's agricultural sector. Our initial pilot focuses on small-scale producers, local merchants, and seamless mobile money integration.

---

## Our Vision & Mission

**Vision:** We're building an accessible, resilient marketplace for agricultural inputs and advisory services using lightweight AI, specifically designed for low-connectivity environments across Mozambique.

**MVP Success Metrics:**
- Achieve product-market fit in one pilot district with 200+ active producers within 90 days
- Process our first 100 paid orders through mobile money integration
- Demonstrate reliable last-mile delivery chains through strategic partnerships
- Capture three months of clean pricing and demand data for market insights

**MVP Lite Objectives:**
- Rapidly deploy a constrained product to validate user onboarding, catalog management, and payment systems
- Maintain manual logistics operations while minimizing automation dependencies
- Implement human-in-the-loop recommendation systems for initial launch

---

## Solution Scope: MVP vs MVP Lite

### MVP Lite (Rapid Validation Phase)
We deliver core marketplace functionality with streamlined operations:
- Phone number registration with OTP verification
- Basic producer profiles including location and crop information
- Read-only product catalog managed by administrators and vendors
- Manual order creation and status tracking
- Single mobile money provider integration
- Progressive Web App with offline catalog caching and synchronization
- Basic admin dashboard for product, order, and vendor management
- WhatsApp support channel with SMS notifications
- Minimal analytics dashboard tracking orders, users, and revenue

### Full MVP (Complete Initial Release)
Our full MVP builds upon MVP Lite with enhanced capabilities:
- Multi-vendor onboarding and catalog management
- Field agent onboarding with mobile support application
- Automated payment adapter supporting multiple local providers
- Order routing and basic logistics integration
- AI-lite features including price alerts and rule-based crop recommendations
- Background job services for notifications and data synchronization
- Redis caching for session and ephemeral data management
- Basic fraud detection and rate limiting systems

---

## Technology Architecture

Our technology stack ensures scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in low-connectivity environments:

**Frontend Development**

# API Specification

## Authentication & Authorization

All API endpoints require TLS encryption. We use JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens obtained through phone OTP verification. Role-based access control supports `producer`, `vendor`, `admin`, and `agent` permissions.

---

## Authentication Service

### Request OTP
Initiates the authentication process by sending a one-time password to the user's mobile device.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/request-otp`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "phone": "+258XXXXXXXXX"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "ttl": 300,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully"
}
```

**Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: OTP sent successfully
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Too many OTP requests
- `500 Internal Server Error`: SMS provider failure

---

### Verify OTP
Validates the OTP and returns authentication tokens upon successful verification.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_expires": 3600,
  "user": {
    "id": "u1",
    "phone": "+258XXXXXXXXX",
    "role": "producer",

  }
}
```

**Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: OTP verified successfully

### Refresh Token
Obtains a new access token using a valid refresh token.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/refresh`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",

## Offline-First Strategy

We prioritize accessibility in low-connectivity environments through:

**Progressive Web App Capabilities**
- Service worker implementation for essential asset caching
- IndexedDB storage for catalog data and draft orders
- Background synchronization when connectivity resumes

**Bandwidth Optimization**
- ETag implementation for efficient data transfer
- Gzip compression for all API responses
- Lazy loading of non-essential images and assets

**Alternative Access Methods**
- USSD/SMS workflows for basic operations
- Order status checking via simple code-based queries
- Fallback communication channels for critical notifications

## Security & Compliance

**Data Protection**
- End-to-end TLS encryption for all data transmissions
- Database encryption at rest with regular security audits
- Minimal PII storage with anonymized analytics data

**Authentication Security**
- Short-lived OTP sessions with configurable expiration
- JWT token rotation with secure refresh mechanisms
- Rate limiting and brute force protection

**Regulatory Compliance**
- Localized consent forms in Portuguese during registration
- LGPD-compliant data processing and storage practices
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance reporting
